DesktopAnalytics.net
===============================

[Segment.IO](http://segment.io) provides a nice <i>server-oriented</i> library in [Analytics.net](https://github.com/segmentio/Analytics.NET). This project is just one little class that wraps that to provide some standard behavior needed by <i>desktop</i> applications:

+ Supplies guids for user ids, saves that in a Settings file
+ Set $Browser to the Operating System Version (e.g. "Windows 8").
+ Auto events
 + First launch ("Create" to fit MixPanel's expectation)
 + Version Upgrade
